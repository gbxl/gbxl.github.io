In 2020, I finally got around to re-start a good reading habit. I meant to do it for a while but always got distracted by more brain stimulating activities like watching endless youtube and scrolling Reddit.

To celebrate this achievement, I am making this page that will centralize my thoughts about the books, e-books and audio books I read/listen to.

[Astrophysics for People in a Hurry - 2017 (Neil deGrasse Tyson)](/book/review/2020/05/10/astrophysics-for-people-in-a-hurry)
[Where good ideas come from - 2010 (Steven Johnson)](/book/review/2020/05/10/good-ideas)
Accessory to War - 2018 (Neil deGrasse Tyson)
The Three Body Problem - 2008 (Liu Cixin)
How to Read the Bible - 2007 (James L. Kugel)
