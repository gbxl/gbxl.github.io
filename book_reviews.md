In 2020, I finally got around to re-start a good reading habit. I meant to do it for a while but always got distracted by more brain stimulating activities like watching endless youtube and scrolling Reddit.

To celebrate this achievement, I am making this page that will centralize my thoughts about the books, e-books and audio books I read/listen to.
