By Liu Cixin, published 2008

I've always wondered why science fiction authors don't get more credit? You always hear about the literature classics and how amazing they are and how these authors are so prominent in their use of the language that reading these books is like taking a college literature class.
The Three Body Problem is surprisingly scientifically accurate but also highly descriptive and immersive. Not only the landscape descriptions are transportative but the emotions depicted are relatable and intense. The plot is believable until 3/4 of the book unravels, there is a good amount of mounting suspense as to what is going on, followed by a good unpacking that ties loose ends. I enjoyed the heavy math and physics concepts approached as well as the historical background meshing in with some alternative present timeline. Masterfully executed.
My only gripe with the story lays with the "Trisolarian civilization" and how conveniently close and similar they happen to be to humans. Looking forward to the second book of the series which I was told, is a wild page turner. TBC.

4.5/5
