By Neil deGrasse Tyson, published 2017

Great introduction into the world of astrophysics for the outsider. Aside from vague notions I remember from high-school and the few things that I picked up here and there reading articles, I know nothing about physics. Reading a bit about space exploration and the awesome engineering that goes on behind rocket science got me more and more interested. Comes 'Astrophysics for People in a Hurry'. I picked it up at a sweet book store in Berkley, CA and set out to read it's ~250 pages over the course of the next few months. In 2 weeks I was done. Very smooth read, great fluidity, the author gives enough specifics to not sound vague but the book doesn't require a PhD to follow along.
Overall this page-turner gave me a better appreciation for our universe and the people trying to figure it all out (good luck to them). The gist I'd say is that the universe is big and we could totally be wrong about the things we have assumed so far. The only thing we know for sure is that we don't know much!

Recommended for all kind of readers. Not a big time investment. Stay away if you are a physics buff, you will probably find shortcuts and other inaccuracies not meant for you smart people ;)

4.5/5
